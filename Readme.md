## These are our goals:

1. Using the powershell as much as possible -- especially to start a new jupyter notebook
2. Having all your notebooks in one folder with Git enabled
3. Having this Git enabled folder also shared into github so I can contribute to it aswell

#### GOAL 1: Using Powershell

You need to:

1. make sure python is accessible from your powershell.

   - To check:
     - open powershell
     - type: `python --version`
     - You should see a version number<br>
       **If you dony see it then go here `https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/`** <br>
       _NOTE that you need to look and see which folder has your python.exe file!_

2. make sure pip is installed and accessible <br>
   pip is a tool that helps you install different python modules and use them

   - To check:
     - open powershell
     - type: `pip --version`
     - You should see a version number<br>
       **If you dont then go here and follow: `https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/`**

3. make sure jupyter notebook is installed and asscessible from powershell
   - To check:
     - open powershell
     - type: `python -m notebook --version`
     - You should see a version number<br>
       **If you dont then go type: `pip install jupyter`** <br>
       **TO INSTALL YOU NEED TO HAVE POWERSHELL OPENED AS AN ADMINISTRATOR**

#### GOAL 2: Git enabled folder with all notebooks

First lets focus on git

1. make sure you have git installed

   - To check:
     - open powershell
     - type: `git --version`
     - You should see a version number<br>
       **If you dony see it then go here to download the file (check if your computer is 64 bit or 32 bit first!) `https://git-scm.com/download/win`** <br>
       - In the installation make sure you:
         - Add to PATH
         - GUI is not needed - it takes up a lot of space and we will use powershell or other tools for all git things

2. make sure you have a github account

   - Go to `www.github.com`
   - Create a new account for your self
   - Share your email with me

### GOAL 3: Git enabled folder and github sharing

To do this you first need a good introduction to git. We will cover this step together in a call

- To prepare watch these videos:

  - introduction `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUuTYDg9XoI`
  - first steps `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqP7YZlZEOo`

- Figure out the following:
  - Where do you store your jupyter notebooks on your computer?
